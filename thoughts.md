Go through every element to create a unique key in an object
Go through every element again, if the element matches key then check the next element to add to the property value in an array
Stop when element is null

NO NEED FOR DOUBLE FOR LOOP

iterate through the properties
randomly pick one of the array of values
Take the value selected as the next key
if selection is null, stop AND THEN
